# FOOD-DELIVERY-MANAGEMENT-SYSTEM-GUI
I used the connections between a database with multiple tables and java in this project. It represents a delivery system, where the client can command any of the base foods and even can create a menu, which also will be saved in the database. There are employees also, and GUIs for all kinds of people.
